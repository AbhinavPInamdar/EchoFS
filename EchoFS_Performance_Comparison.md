// Estimated memory usage per file
type FileMetadata struct {
    FileID      string    // 36 bytes (UUID)
    Name        string    // ~50 bytes average
    Size        int64     // 8 bytes
    Chunks      []string  // ~100 bytes per chunk
    Timestamps  time.Time // 24 bytes

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### EchoFS Optimization Roadmap

```go
// Current: Sequential processing
func (s *Server) UploadFile(file []byte) error {
    compressed := s.compress(file)      // Sequential
    chunks := s.chunk(compressed)       // Sequential
    for _, chunk := range chunks {
        s.storeChunk(chunk)             // Sequential
    }
}

// Optimized: Parallel processing
func (s *Server) ParallelUpload(file []byte) error {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    chunks := s.streamingChunk(file)    // Stream processing
    
    for chunk := range chunks {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(c Chunk) {
            defer wg.Done()
            s.compressAndStore(c)       // Parallel
        }(chunk)
    }
    wg.Wait()
}
```

#### Phase 2: Connection Pooling (Est. 2-3x improvement)
```go
type WorkerPool struct {
    connections sync.Map
    maxConns    int
}

func (p *WorkerPool) GetConnection(workerID string) *grpc.ClientConn {
    // Reuse connections, reduce setup overhead
}
```

#### Phase 3: Streaming Operations (Est. 3-5x improvement)
```go
func (s *Server) StreamingUpload(stream pb.FileService_StreamUploadServer) {
    // Process chunks as they arrive
    // Don't wait for complete file
}
```

### Expected Performance After Optimization

|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Small File Ops  | 1,000/sec   | 5,000/sec   | 5x          |
| Large File BW   | 50 MB/s     | 500 MB/s    | 10x         |
| Latency (avg)   | 2ms         | 1ms         | 2x          |
| Concurrent Ops  | 100         | 1,000       | 10x         |
