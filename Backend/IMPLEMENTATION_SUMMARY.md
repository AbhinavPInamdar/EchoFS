# EchoFS Adaptive Consistency System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the adaptive consistency system for EchoFS, including all components, features, and experimental validation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### 1. Consistency Controller (`cmd/consistency-controller/`)
**Purpose**: Central decision-making service for consistency mode management

**Key Features**:
- Policy-based decision engine with weighted scoring
- Multi-sample confirmation with hysteresis (prevents flapping)
- Crash recovery with persistent state management
- Operator overrides and critical key protection
- Emergency mode for severe network partitions

**API Endpoints**:
```
GET  /v1/mode?object_id=<id>     # Get current consistency mode
POST /v1/hint                    # Set consistency hint
POST /v1/override                # Set global override
GET  /v1/critical-keys           # Manage critical keys
GET  /health                     # Health check
GET  /status                     # Controller status
```

### 2. Replication Manager (`internal/replication/`)
**Purpose**: Manages different replication strategies based on consistency requirements

**Components**:
- **Sync Strategy**: Quorum-based writes with majority acknowledgment
- **Async Strategy**: Immediate local write + background replication queue
- **Worker Pool**: Health monitoring and load balancing across workers

**Features**:
- Configurable quorum sizes and timeouts
- Background replication with retry logic
- Comprehensive metrics and statistics
- Automatic failover and recovery

### 3. Extended Metadata (`internal/metadata/model.go`)
**Purpose**: Enhanced object metadata with consistency control fields

**Key Fields**:
```go
type ObjectMeta struct {
    FileID         string
    ModeHint       string               // "Auto", "Strong", "Available"
    CurrentMode    string               // "C", "A", "Hybrid"
    LastVersion    int64
    VectorClock    map[string]int64     // For conflict resolution
    LastSyncTs     time.Time
    LastModeChange time.Time
    // ... other fields
}
```

### 4. Persistent Storage (`internal/storage/badger_store.go`)
**Purpose**: Durable storage for metadata with WAL support

**Features**:
- BadgerDB-based persistent storage
- WAL flush for strong consistency writes
- State reconciliation on startup
- Backup and restore capabilities
- Garbage collection and optimization

### 5. Conflict Resolution (`internal/conflict/resolution.go`)
**Purpose**: Multiple strategies for handling conflicting updates

**Strategies**:
- **Last-Writer-Wins**: Simple timestamp-based resolution
- **Vector Clock Merge**: Semantic merge using vector clocks
- **Manual Resolution**: Queue conflicts for operator review
- **CRDT**: Conflict-free replicated data types for commutative data

### 6. Policy Engine (`internal/controller/policy.go`)
**Purpose**: Intelligent decision-making for consistency modes

**Decision Factors**:
```go
score = 0.4*partitionRisk + 0.3*replicationLag + 
        0.2*writeRate + 0.1*userHint - 0.2*recentChangePenalty

if score > 0.6 ‚Üí Available mode
if score < 0.3 ‚Üí Strong mode  
else ‚Üí Hybrid mode
```

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### Adaptive Decision Making
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of network conditions
- **Policy-based Decisions**: Weighted scoring system for mode selection
- **Hysteresis**: Multi-sample confirmation prevents mode flapping

### Consistency Guarantees
- **Strong Mode (C)**: Quorum writes, read-your-writes consistency
- **Available Mode (A)**: Immediate acknowledgment, eventual consistency
- **Hybrid Mode**: Per-operation decisions based on current conditions

### Fault Tolerance
- **Controller Recovery**: Persistent state with automatic reconciliation
- **Worker Health Monitoring**: Automatic failover and load balancing
- **Network Partition Handling**: Graceful degradation to Available mode
- **Conflict Resolution**: Multiple strategies for handling concurrent updates

### Operational Controls
- **Global Overrides**: Force all objects to specific consistency mode
- **Critical Keys**: Always-strong consistency for important objects
- **Manual Interventions**: Operator controls for emergency situations
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Detailed metrics and alerting
